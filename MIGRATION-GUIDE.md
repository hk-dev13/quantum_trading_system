# Quantum Trading System - Migration Guide

## Migration Status âœ…

The codebase has been successfully separated into dual repositories:

1. **Public Repository** (`/home/husni/public-quantum-trading/`)
   - Core infrastructure and community components
   - API gateway and documentation
   - Example implementations and tests

2. **Private Repository** (`/home/husni/private-quantum-vault/`)
   - Proprietary algorithms and strategies
   - Risk management and market intelligence
   - Security configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Setup**
   ```bash
   # Initialize Git in both repositories if not already done
   cd /home/husni/public-quantum-trading
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial public repository setup"

   cd /home/husni/private-quantum-vault
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial private repository setup"
   ```

2. **Configure Remote Repositories**
   ```bash
   # For public repo
   cd /home/husni/public-quantum-trading
   git remote add origin <public-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main

   # For private repo
   cd /home/husni/private-quantum-vault
   git remote add origin <private-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Security Setup**
   - Enable branch protection rules
   - Configure 2FA for all team members
   - Set up RBAC using the provided configurations
   - Enable security scanning and audit logging

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Use the API bridge for communication between repos
   - Follow security protocols for private repo access
   - Keep documentation updated in public repo
   - Regular security audits and updates

- [ ] Security measures implemented and tested
- [ ] API bridge functioning correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated in both repos
- [ ] Team access configured properly
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines established
